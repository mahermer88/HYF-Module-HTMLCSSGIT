Command Line Interface challenge

#- Starting:
*Run the Git Bash and looking for the directory and change it to desktop by: cd desktop
*Then create a new folder with name 'hyf-html-exercises' by: mkdir hyf-html-exercises
*Then change the directory again to the new folder by: cd hyf-html-exercises  
*Then also create a new folder inside it by: mkdir week1
*Then change the directory to last folder by: cd week1
*Then create a text file for homework by: touch homework.txt


1- How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

*To hide any file or folder by command: attrib +h filename
*To make it visible again,firstly we should know its name using the command: ls
*We can see hidden folders or files, by pass a parameter to previous comnand by using the â€“a option: ls -a 
*After we have known the hidden folder or file name, we can make it visible again by command: attrib -h filename
*If it is a hidden folder, we can display its contents by command: ls -a
*If it is hidden file,we can display its contents by command: cat filename


2-How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

*We can create multiple nested directories, by adding a parameter -p to the comnand mkdir: mkdir -p 
*In my case i did: mkdir -p desktop/hyf-html-exercises/week1/nesteddirectories/folderforfun

3-How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message

*We can add text to file using command cat and its parameter > 
*Therefore to edit our homework file, we use command: cat > homework.txt
*Then write our text, press enter and ending by: ctrl + D
*Every time, we used the previous way, it will be overwrite on the content of the file, so we need to add new line in the same file.
*Therefore, we can use the same command cat but with another parameter, by: cat >> homework.txt
*Then could write our new text for the new line, press enter and end by: ctrl + D
*There are other options that went deeper in editing file. I saw them during searching but using them need more than my currently knowledge, such as command-line editor's vi, nano and joe.
