           <h2>First coronavirus vaccine in the Netherlands was given on Jan. 5</h2>
           <time>6 Jan 2021 </time>
           <p>A day after the Dutch government was criticized for not being ready to quickly start vaccinating the public against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said the country will administer its first vaccine dose on January 8. The date would rely on the European Medicines Agency giving its approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which has already received the green light in the United Kingdom and the United States.
               In a statement, the Ministry of Health said people will be invited to get the vaccine starting on January 4. Those who receive the first invitations can then call to book an appointment. The first group to be inoculated will be care home staff, people who provide care to those with disabilities, in-home nurses, and home healthcare support workers.

         <h2>Lockdown effect still to be felt as cases fall but positive test rate rises</h2>
           <time>6 Jan 2021</time>
           <p>The national lockdown has still not made a serious impact on the levels of coronavirus infection after three weeks, despite a 16.2% drop in the number of positive tests, latest weekly figures show.
            The fall in recorded cases was largely the result of fewer tests being carried out, with 56,440 people testing positive in the week to January 5 compared to 67,388 the week before, according to the public health agency RIVM. However, the proportion of positive tests increased from 13.0% to 13.7%.
            Prime minister Mark Rutte acknowledged during Tuesday’s debate on the government’s pandemic strategy that the chances of being able to ease the lockdown on January 19 were receding. ‘If you look at the current infection numbers it doesn’t look very hopeful,’ he said.
